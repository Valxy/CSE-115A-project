##### Actions to stop doing
There are no actions that the steam should necessarily stop doing. This is not because we are completely satisfied with our current process, but because we were doing a minimal set of positive actions.

##### Actions to start doing
The team should follow the guidelines for "The Daily Scrum." In particular, we need to be more diligent about asking the three questions: What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Is there anything in your way? I also believe that we should collaborate more on user stories, and their subsequent breakdown into the technical tasks. We should also begin more comprehensive documentation regarding the scrum process. 

##### Actions to keep doing
Our team meetings are productive. It's important that we find a way to continue that productivity throughout any changes to the structure of our meetings. We are also dividing tasks well, and everyone is pulling their weight in regards to contributions to the codebase. 

##### Work completed and not completed
Sprint one was supposed to see the completion of the explore tab, but this proved more difficult than anticipated when mixed in with the spikes. It was also the period that the details page was going to be delivered in a minimal form, but the integration of all the moving parts simply requires more time. The navigation bar, on the brighter side, was completed. So that's one user story down.  
   
Among the user stories of the first sprint was a giant push to learn a new (both to us, and the world, flutter is less than five years old) technology, its framework, and the language the framework uses. On the backend, most of the first sprint was spent researching the viability of the different end points of the API. And as for infrastructure, the high level layout of the application is complete. Integration of the backend is all that's left; however, that may be the most difficult part, but it's as of yet to be determined. 

##### Work completion rate
We completed one user story, as written, in its entirety over a fourteen day sprint. For the metrics, that results in one user story every fourteen days or 1/14 user stories per day. Based on the evaluation of ideal work hours, that would put the group at 5/14 ideal work hours per day. It's important to note that spikes are not accounted for in these rates.
