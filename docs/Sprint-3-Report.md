## Actions to Stop Doing

- Reduce our meeting times (we had 2 long meetings (over 1.5 hours) every week)
  - We should make our meetings more concise and focus on not straying off course. We should also hold long meetings only when they are necessary and not extend smaller meetings.
- Focusing on more important features and implementations and then focusing on smaller incremental changes --> "get the things working well first and then improve it further"
- Editing, changing, or adding code or other implementation in other people's tasks or code without them knowing or without their permission (this leads to confusion, annoyance, and a lack of team communication and integrity)

## Actions to Start Doing

- Have shorter meetings / more Scrum stand-ups during the week
- Keep frequent track of our burn-up chart / update it frequently
- Keep track of completed tasks on the day they were completed; log every day you work on the project how many hours you spent (improves accuracy of burn-up charts)
- Communicate clearly and frequently with individuals who are working on a task that you plan to work on for a small period of time (do not work on something without the main leader for that task knowing about it)

## Actions to Keep Doing

- We had good communication on Discord regarding updating each other on progress, resolving and bringing up problems, etc.
- We touch on every aspect of the project every meeting (Scrum stand-ups, reviewing current MVP, talking about details and Sprint plans, etc.)
- We are dedicated and working hard on our tasks → we don’t shy away from working when we have less tasks to complete


## Work Completed and Not Completed

- The Explore tab is mostly complete (almost fully implemented). It now shows a total of six lists for both Movies and TV shows with the appropriate information for each item.
  - The performance is a bit slow however when loading the information because of how the API calls are handled. We need to improve this.
  - There are some bugs (potentially small) which are holding back some of the tasks from being labelled as "done," which is why the Explore tab is also not 100% complete.
  - The visual appearance is the last task that needs to be finished, aside from fixing some bugs, in order to satisfy the requirements of the MVP for the Explore tab.
- The Search tab is now fully implemented and it works properly. The visuals were improved and the functionality was enhanced.
  - If we have any additional ideas, the visuals may be improved or other search options may be implemented.
  - Overall however, we see the Search tab as complete for the MVP requirements.
- Details pages for Movies and TV Shows
  - Most of the information was implemented for the Movies details page, aside from the Movie reviews which we will be working on in Sprint 4.
  - The visuals were also improved for the Movie details page, and the Movie trailer was also implemented, as well as other displayed information we planned to add.
  - We did decide to not include some information on display (such as production status or revenue) which was planned for in Sprint 3.
  - The TV shows details page has not yet been fully implemented or connected to the rest of the app. It is a large focus in our Sprint 4 plan and it's mostly a copy and paste process of the movie Details page.
  - We are still looking at other elements we can add or other ways we might improve the visuals of the details pages, but for now it's relatively solid and satisfactory for the MVP requirements.
- The Browse tab has its skeleton visuals and functionality almost fully implemented. This means that the lists, layouts, and the organization of the Browse tab is working. We also have a working filter which we planned in our Sprint 3.
  - The visuals are not there yet however, which is a focus of ours in Sprint 4.
  - We will also be connecting elements of the Browse tab to other locations such as the details pages while also improving its visuals and functionality / performance.
 

## Work Completion Rate

The work completion rate therefore is approximately 71%.

The completion rate (as well as the total completed story points) since each user story has an assigned story point, however I had to estimate the story point values for tasks to monitor our completion rate. The value is better than our value from Sprint 2, however it is still lower than desired because some of the functionality / tasks we planned have some small bugs in them so I didn't count them as "done," and therefore I didn't count them towards the total completion rate. We also underestimated some of the planning, structure, and technical applications we would need to develop and implement. 

As mentioned above, we are happy to see that our completion rate for this Sprint is higher, and we have become more accurate with our estimations. We will continue working on ensuring an understanding of the structure and technical requirements necessary for implementing individual user stories and tasks to enhance our capability of planning them during our Sprints and implementing them according to our plan.
