## Actions to stop doing

- Overtime in SCRUM standups
  - We should take notes during standups, and discuss the items later on.
- Random meetings
  - Team members expressed the desire for an extra regular meeting per week.

## Actions to start doing

- More communication about technical needs between team members
- Keep better track of user stories
- Break down tasks even more

## Actions to keep doing

- Team members are responsive and committed.
- SCRUM standups proved to be useful in providing insights across the team.

## Work completed and not completed

- Details page is redesigned and the majority of tasks allocated are completed
  - But, it turns out to be challenging to implement a widget to display user reviews;
  - still implementing a "tagged" widget for the genres;
  - could become even better in terms of visuals
- Search tab now has the proper searching functionality
  - But, visual improvement is an ongoing effort;
  - could display some extra details (genre, release year, etc.) in the result entries
- Explore tab now uses the information fetched with the API
  - But, need to pass the correct ID to the details page;
  - deal with the bug in the scrollable list;
  - could be better in terms of visuals

## Work completion rate

The work completion rate is 70%.

The seemingly unsatisfactory rate is caused by the underestimation of the technical challenges.

We are becoming more familiar with the technologies, and we are confident that we will improve our estimation in the next sprints, and get closer to the plan.
